# ANDAppByDmitriiPinzari

Description and motivation:

I decided to make an app that would allow users to search for animes this was done using Retrofit API, store tham as watched, as wall as having the posibility to have more information about these animes by clicking on a link. I thought at first that that's not much so i added a chat function as well, where all users can communicate with each other. Even though it will be a mess if there are too many users. I wanted users to see other users as well, and i implemented it, however they cannot check others users profiles (for now hehe).
Of course since users can store animes as watched, there must be a profile as well, where users can see the animes they "checked". And yeah obviously login, register, forgot password features.
